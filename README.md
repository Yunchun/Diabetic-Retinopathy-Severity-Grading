# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Grading
- Created circular crops around retina image centers, improved image illuminations, and added color scales for processing retina images
- Constructed and trained deep learning models (EfficientNet, InceptionV3, DensetNet, ConvNet), which achieved best precision and F1 score above 0.8 in labeling diabetic retinopathy severity levels of retina images
