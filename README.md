# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Grading
After seeing the importance of grading Diabetic Retinopathy severity level in helping doctors take effective treatments for patients, we develop deep learning models to determine DR severity level given a diabetic retina image. We first process retina images, including creating circular crop around the image center to remove uninformative dark areas, improving image illuminations, and adding color scale to images. Then, we develop deep learning models, such as EfficientNet, ConvNet, InceptionV3, VGG, and DenseNet. Moreover, we evaluate the model performance on the test set by measuring and visualizing accuracy, precision, F1 score, recalls, and ROC curves for different DR levels. In the end, we perform retina blood vessel segmentation with U-net and try to remove blood vessels from DR images.
