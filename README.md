# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Grading
- Processed retina images: create circular crop around image center, improve image illuminations, add color scale
- Constructed and trained deep learning models, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, DensetNet, and ConvNet, to label DR severity levels of retina image with best precision and F1 score above 0.8
- Explored retina blood vessel segmentation with U-net
